## Multimodal AI for Autism Assessment

This repository hosts the dataset and Jupyter Notebook used to demonstrate a multimodal artificial intelligence workflow for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) assessment. The project introduces a structured approach to behavioral signal extraction, interpretable model design, and ethical safeguards, offering an accessible starting point for researchers, clinicians, and students who want to explore AI-supported assessment methods.

An interactive Google Colab version of the notebook is available here:
https://tx.ag/arevaloai1

The notebook walks through data loading, preprocessing, feature exploration, model development, and evaluation. Users may run the Colab version directly in the browser or open the notebook locally to adapt the workflow to their own ASD-relevant datasets.

This repository also includes a small sample dataset to illustrate how multimodal inputs can be organized for analysis. All files are intended for instructional and research-oriented use. The original dataset can be found at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kadhiravanucet/multimodal-autism-dataset
